    <h1>Web Application Manifest Sample</h1>
    <p>Available in <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6488656873259008">Chrome 39+</a></p>

    <h3>Hey! I'm a web app!</h3>

 

    <p>
      Try me out in Chrome 39+ on Android: from Chrome's menu, select
      <strong>Add to homescreen</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you tap the new icon on your homescreen, I'll launch as a standalone app,
      with the page displayed in landscape orientation.
